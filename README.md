LearnTemplateMetaProgramming
====
I'm novice at C++ Template Meta Programming. This repository is for studying.
I implemented :
- STL Combination
- Time Estimation Function for Algorithm
- pow FUnction

The list will be updated as I develope and study things...

I'd tried my best to make the functions, but something will not be safe, sadly.
Even if you are aware of the stability of the libraries
